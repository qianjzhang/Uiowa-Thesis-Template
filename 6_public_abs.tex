Prior to your thesis deposit, replace this text with the text of your public abstract.  The text of this abstract should be double spaced and each new paragraph should be indented.

\textbf{This abstract is required for all thesis/dissertations.}  This abstract may be up to 250 words and should be written for a non-academic lay audience.  In writing your public abstract, avoid jargon and technical language as much as possible. 

The ability to communicate research simply and clearly is an important skill. The public abstract helps convey ideas beyond one’s immediate academic circle, facilitating communication with colleagues who do different kinds of work and possess different dimensions of training.

Think of your public abstract as your “elevator pitch” or what you might tell someone who asks, “What is your thesis about?”  You may only have a few minutes to explain it to them while keeping their attention and using terminology you are sure they will understand without further lengthy explanation.    

Another way to think of your public abstract is like the description you would read on the inside of a book cover.
